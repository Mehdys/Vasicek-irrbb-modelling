# Vasicek-irrbb-modelling

This repository provides tools and notebooks for modelling Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) using the Vasicek model.

## Contents

- `Calibration_Vasicek.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for calibrating the Vasicek model to interest rate data. It covers the steps to fit Vasicek parameters to historical rates, visualize the results, and analyze model performance.
- `PortfeuilleSimplifié_2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating IRRBB analysis on a simplified portfolio. It includes portfolio construction, risk assessment, and simulation using the Vasicek framework.

## Usage

- Use `Calibration_Vasicek.ipynb` to understand and calibrate the Vasicek model for interest rates.
- Use `PortfeuilleSimplifié_2.ipynb` to apply the model to a sample portfolio and analyze IRRBB.
